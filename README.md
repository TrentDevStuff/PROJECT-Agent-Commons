# Agent Commons

**Everything will change with the introduction of AI. How can we steer that change to make a better world?**

This project explores AI-enabled organizational models that could replace traditional corporate hierarchy, democratic governance, and socialist planning. The core question—how to steer AI-driven change toward broader human prosperity—may lead to very different models than initially envisioned.

## Current Working Concept

The **Agent Commons** is a three-layer organizational model:

### 1. Agent
Autonomous individuals (human or AI). Self-directed, free to come and go, captain of their own ship.

### 2. Forg (Fork + Org, Forge + Org)
Self-organizing teams that form around projects/ideas within the commons. They form, deliver, dissolve, or fork.

### 3. Agent Commons
The platform/system itself. Contains constraints, embodies rules, contains the economy/incentives, contains AI judges (LLMs), publishes and monetizes outputs (app-store model), and distributes proceeds. Takes a slice for sustainability.

## Key Principles

- **Rewards contribution** (ideas that lead teams, effort in execution), not hierarchy or ownership
- **AI/LLM governance** replaces management hierarchy and C-suite
- **Open-source principles** with git-like organization
- **Marketplace dynamics** for natural selection of ideas
- **Self-regulating** within system parameters
- **Forkable** — can grow, change, split, and evolve organically
- **Hedges against human nature** — learns from failures of democracy, socialism, and corporatism
- **Spreads prosperity** gained from AI productivity

## Important Note

**This concept is just one manifestation** of what the world might look like. The deeper question—how to steer AI-driven change toward a better world—may lead to very different models. Stay open.

## Current Work

See `EFFORT-Brainstorming-Research/EFFORT.md` for active research areas:

1. **Problems with Organizational Structures** — How to avoid failures of democracy, socialism, corporatism
2. **AI-Driven Societal Changes** — Knowledge democratization, self-organizing teams, economic implications
3. **Similar Models and Precedents** — Open-source, DAOs, cooperatives, platform economics
