# 1.2 Socialism / Central Planning: Hedge-and-Crack Analysis

## The Hedges — What Socialism Was Designed to Protect Against

Marx was fundamentally a diagnostician of organizational failure. His critique of capitalism identified specific human tendencies that capitalism's structures failed to contain or actively amplified. The hedges were logically coherent responses to real problems.

### The Human-Nature Problems Marx Identified

**Exploitation (rent-seeking and extraction).** Marx's surplus value theory argued that capitalist organization structurally enabled owners to extract value from workers beyond their compensation. **The hedge:** abolish private ownership of the means of production. If no one owns the factory, no one can extract rent from those who work in it.

**Alienation (disconnection from purpose).** In *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844*, Marx identified four forms of alienation: from the product of labor, from the process, from fellow workers, and from human creative potential. **The hedge:** collective ownership reconnects workers to the fruits of their labor.

**Class conflict (factional competition).** Historical materialism argued all history was class struggle — organizational structures dividing people into antagonistic groups. **The hedge:** eliminate classes by eliminating the economic basis for class distinction (private property).

**Market anarchy (coordination failure).** Engels in *Anti-Duhring* and Marx in *Capital* described boom-bust cycles, overproduction crises, and waste through unemployment. **The hedge:** replace the "anarchy of production" with conscious, rational central planning.

### Lenin's Organizational Additions

- **The vanguard party** — hedge against false consciousness; a disciplined party maintains ideological clarity where the masses, shaped by capitalist ideology, cannot
- **Democratic centralism** — debate freely before a decision, execute unanimously after; hedges against both factionalism and groupthink
- **Gosplan** — professional economic planning bodies replacing market signals; centralizes the "whole picture" that individual actors can't see

### Hedge-to-Tendency Mapping

| Hedge | Human Tendency Targeted | Mechanism |
|-------|------------------------|-----------|
| Abolish private property | Greed / rent-seeking | Remove the structural position from which extraction occurs |
| Central planning | Selfish short-termism | Replace individual profit-maximizing with collective rational allocation |
| Collective ownership | Power concentration | Distribute ownership so no individual can accumulate disproportionate control |
| Classless society | Tribalism / factionalism | Remove the economic basis for group identity and conflict |
| "From each...to each according to need" | Free-riding / hoarding | Decouple contribution from reward to eliminate competitive hoarding |
| Democratic worker control | Domination / authoritarianism | Give workers direct control over their conditions |
| Abolish inheritance | Dynastic accumulation | Prevent intergenerational compounding of advantage |

### Critical Note

The socialist design was not stupid. It identified real problems in capitalist organization (exploitation, alienation, boom-bust cycles, inequality). The hedges were logically connected to the problems identified. **The failure was not in the diagnosis but in the treatment** — the hedges themselves created new cracks for the same human tendencies to exploit.

---

## The Cracks — Where Human Nature Breaks Through

### Crack 1: Nomenklatura / New Elite Formation (Power-Seeking)

**Human tendency:** Humans seek status, influence, and preferential access to resources. This tendency appears in every primate social group. Remove one hierarchy and humans construct another.

**How it bypasses the hedge:** Socialism eliminated the capitalist class but required an administrative apparatus. This apparatus — Party, bureaucracy, planning committees — became the new vehicle for power-seeking. The hedge (abolish private property to prevent power concentration) was bypassed because power can concentrate through *control* of collectively owned assets just as effectively as through *ownership* of private ones. The person who decides how the factory's output is allocated has the same effective power as the person who owns the factory — arguably more, because their power is backed by the state's monopoly on violence.

**Historical evidence:**

**(a) The Soviet Nomenklatura System.** By the Brezhnev era, the nomenklatura comprised roughly 750,000 positions (with families, ~3 million people in a nation of 270 million — about 1.1%). Members had access to:
- Special stores (Beryozka) selling imported Western goods unavailable to ordinary citizens
- Special healthcare at the Fourth Main Directorate (Kremlin Hospital), with dramatically better outcomes
- Dachas in exclusive compounds with domestic staff
- Chauffeured ZIL limousines in dedicated lanes
- Foreign travel privileges denied to 99%+ of citizens
- Elite education with guaranteed professional careers for their children

Mervyn Matthews (*Privilege in the Soviet Union*, 1978) documented top Party officials earning 10-40x the average worker's salary when in-kind benefits were included. Milovan Djilas (*The New Class*, 1957) argued communist systems inevitably produced a new ruling class defined by *control* of collective property rather than *ownership* of private property. Key insight: the *function* of a ruling class (extracting surplus, maintaining privilege, reproducing intergenerationally) was preserved even when the *form* changed.

**(b) Chinese Communist Party Cadres.** "Princelings" (children of revolutionary leaders) occupied vastly disproportionate top positions. Bruce Dickson (*Red Capitalists in China*, 2003) documented how Party membership became the primary vehicle for economic advantage. After market reforms, Party-connected families moved into the most lucrative business positions. Bloomberg reported in 2012 that top 8 retired CCP leaders' families had accumulated wealth estimated at $1.6 billion (likely undercounted). The "classless society" reproduced class through party membership and factional networks.

**(c) Cuban Revolutionary Elite.** Fidel Castro, who led a revolution against Batista's corrupt elite, reportedly accumulated a fortune estimated by Forbes (2006) at ~$900 million. Juan Reinaldo Sanchez, Castro's former bodyguard, described in *The Double Life of Fidel Castro* (2014) private islands, yacht fleets, and luxury rivaling any capitalist oligarch.

**The pattern:** Power-seeking is hydraulic. Block one channel (private ownership) and it flows through another (party position, bureaucratic control, revolutionary credentials). The hedge failed because it could not abolish the *human tendency*, only one particular *expression* of it.

---

### Crack 2: The Motivation Crisis (Free-Riding)

**Human tendency:** Humans calibrate effort to expected reward. When contribution is disconnected from personal benefit, effort declines toward the minimum necessary to avoid punishment. This is not laziness — it is rational behavior under the incentive structure.

**How it bypasses the hedge:** "From each according to ability, to each according to need" was designed to eliminate competitive greed. But it created a massive free-rider problem. If your income, housing, and standing are roughly the same whether you work hard or coast, the rational strategy is to coast. The hedge against greed created a crack for free-riding.

**Historical evidence:**

**(a) Soviet Agriculture: Private Plots vs. Collective Farms.** The single most devastating empirical evidence against the motivation hedge:

| Metric | Private Plots | Collective Farms |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Share of cultivated land | ~3% | ~97% |
| Share of total agricultural output (by value) | ~25-30% | ~70-75% |
| Share of potatoes produced | ~66% | ~34% |
| Share of fruits & vegetables | ~40% | ~60% |
| Productivity per hectare | ~7-10x higher | Baseline |

The same people, same soil, same climate. The *only* variable was the incentive structure: on private plots, you kept what you grew. On collective farms, output went to the state at fixed prices.

**(b) Chinese Communes vs. Household Responsibility System.** Deng Xiaoping's 1978-1979 reforms decollectivized farming. Families could sell surplus at market prices after meeting a quota. Justin Yifu Lin ("Rural Reforms and Agricultural Growth in China," *American Economic Review*, 1992):
- Grain output increased ~34% between 1978 and 1984
- Total agricultural output grew ~61%
- ~46-48% of the increase was attributable to the incentive change alone
- Rural poverty dropped from ~76% (1980) to ~23% (1985) — World Bank data

Same land, same people, same technology. Changed incentives, massive output surge.

**(c) Kibbutz Free-Riding.** Ran Abramitzky (*The Mystery of the Kibbutz*, 2018):
- High-ability members increasingly left (adverse selection), with exit rates for high-earners 2-3x those of low-earners
- By the 2000s, ~75% of kibbutzim had abandoned collective compensation
- Surviving "traditional" kibbutzim were disproportionately those with strong religious or ideological identity (an additional non-economic motivator)

**The Soviet joke captures it:** "They pretend to pay us, we pretend to work" (*Oni delayut vid, chto nam platyat, my delayem vid, chto rabotayem*). Not cynicism — an accurate description of the equilibrium the incentive structure produced.

---

### Crack 3: The Calculation Problem (Information Hoarding and Distortion)

**Human tendency:** Humans hoard information that gives them advantage and distort information that threatens them. Additionally, even with good intentions, no central authority can aggregate the dispersed, tacit, local knowledge that billions of actors possess.

**Two distinct but reinforcing problems:**

**(i) The Hayekian knowledge problem.** Friedrich Hayek ("The Use of Knowledge in Society," 1945): the price system aggregates dispersed information no central planner could collect. The price of steel reflects millions of facts about ore, energy, transportation, labor, competing uses, and future expectations. Eliminating prices destroyed the information channel.

Ludwig von Mises ("Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth," 1920): without market prices for capital goods, there is no rational basis for comparing efficiency of alternative production methods.

**(ii) The incentive to distort.** Local actors had strong incentives to misrepresent. Factory managers reporting excess capacity would receive higher quotas. Those reporting scarcity would receive more resources. The rational strategy: understate capacity, overstate needs, game whatever metric planners use.

**Historical evidence:**

**(a) Soviet Quota Gaming — Goodhart's Law at Scale.** Alec Nove (*The Soviet Economic System*, 1977/1986) documented dozens of examples:
- Quotas set in tons → factories produced the heaviest possible items (enormous useless nails)
- Quotas switched to quantity → factories produced the smallest possible items (tiny useless nails)
- Quotas by linear meters (textiles) → factories produced the narrowest possible fabric
- Chandelier factory measured by weight → chandeliers so heavy they pulled down ceilings
- Glass factories measured by tons → glass so thick it was nearly opaque
- Trucking measured by ton-kilometers → preference for long hauls of heavy goods, short-distance freight unserved

Every quantitative target became a Goodhart's Law problem: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

**(b) Great Leap Forward Reporting.** Local officials massively overstated grain production (reported yields of 10,000+ jin/mu — ~75 tons/hectare — physically impossible; actual yields ~1-2 tons/hectare). Based on fictional reports, the central government requisitioned grain that left peasants without food. Result: the Great Chinese Famine, estimated 15-55 million deaths (Dikotter's *Mao's Great Famine*, 2010, estimates 45 million). **Information distortion, amplified by fear of punishment for bad news, killed tens of millions.**

**(c) Gosplan's Computational Impossibility.** By the 1980s, the Soviet economy contained ~24 million distinct products. Setting prices, quantities, and allocation for each would require solving ~10^8+ simultaneous equations. Gosplan actually set prices for only ~200,000 key products; the rest were allocated through informal networks, barter, and the shadow economy. The gap between what planners could coordinate and what needed coordinating widened inexorably.

---

### Crack 4: Ideological Blindness (Self-Deception)

**Human tendency:** Humans rationalize failures to protect self-concept and social identity. Groups amplify this through conformity pressure. When ideology becomes central to identity, contradictory evidence is reinterpreted or denied.

**How it bypasses the hedge:** Socialist systems elevated Marxism-Leninism to scientific truth. The ideology predicted socialism would outperform capitalism economically. When it didn't, available explanations that preserved the ideology were: (a) external enemies, (b) internal enemies, (c) insufficient commitment. All three led to doubling down rather than reform. The ideology became unfalsifiable.

**Historical evidence:**

**(a) Lysenkoism (1930s-1964).** Trofim Lysenko rejected Mendelian genetics for neo-Lamarckian theory (organisms pass on acquired characteristics) — aligned with Marxist ideology that environment reshapes nature. With Stalin's backing, Lysenko dominated Soviet biology for ~30 years:
- Geneticists fired, imprisoned, executed. Nikolai Vavilov (world-renowned geneticist) arrested 1940, died in prison 1943
- Agricultural techniques based on Lysenko's theories failed repeatedly but were mandated nationwide
- Soviet Union fell decades behind in genetics, molecular biology, agricultural science
- Influence extended to China during the Great Leap Forward, compounding the famine

**(b) The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962).** Based on the premise that revolutionary enthusiasm substitutes for technical expertise. Backyard steel furnaces produced useless pig iron. Sparrow eradication ("Four Pests" campaign) destroyed insect predators, contributing to locust plagues. When cadres reported famine, Mao dismissed it as rightist sabotage. The central leadership continued grain exports during the famine to maintain appearances. 15-55 million deaths.

**(c) The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).** When pragmatic reforms in the early 1960s (Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping) began producing results through limited market mechanisms, Mao perceived ideological betrayal. The Cultural Revolution purged "capitalist roaders":
- Estimated 500,000-2 million deaths
- 36 million persecuted
- Universities closed for years
- Economy contracted; GDP growth near-zero during 1967-1968
- Scientific and industrial capacity set back by a decade+

**The system's immune response targeted its own repair mechanisms.** Self-deception at organizational scale: the ideology demanded that pragmatic reforms were the enemy, so the system attacked the people trying to fix it.

---

### Crack 5: Systemic Rigidity (Loss Aversion)

**Human tendency:** Humans overweight losses relative to gains. People holding positions within a system resist changes that threaten their position, even if changes would benefit the system as a whole.

**How it bypasses the hedge:** The socialist hedge assumed planners would be dispassionate optimizers. In practice, every element developed defenders: factory managers whose status depended on their factory, party officials whose power derived from planning authority, entire cities built around single industries. Reform threatened all of them. The system optimized for its own continuation.

**Historical evidence:**

**(a) Brezhnev Stagnation (1964-1982).** Brezhnev explicitly promised "stability of cadres" — no purges, no disruptive reforms. Result: 18 years of institutional sclerosis.

| Decade | Official Soviet GDP Growth | CIA Retrospective Estimate | Maddison Project |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 1950s | ~10% annual | ~5-6% | ~5-6% |
| 1960s | ~7% annual | ~4-5% | ~4-5% |
| 1970s | ~5% annual | ~2-3% | ~2-3% |
| 1980s | ~3-4% annual | ~1-2% | ~1-2% |
| 1989-91 | ~2% | Negative | Negative |

- Average age of Politburo members rose steadily — leadership literally aged in place
- Military spending ~15-25% of GDP vs. ~6% for the US, but no reallocation possible
- Kosygin's 1965 reforms (limited profit incentives) effectively sabotaged by the bureaucracy

**(b) Gorbachev's Paradox (1985-1991).** Reform triggered collapse rather than renewal:
- Partial price liberalization created worse shortages (prices rose but centrally-managed supply chains couldn't respond)
- Glasnost revealed the ideology-reality gap, destroying legitimacy faster than reforms built new legitimacy
- The system was so rigid that loosening any element destabilized the others — they were all load-bearing in a system with no flexibility

**(c) The OGAS Project.** Viktor Glushkov's 1960s proposal for a nationwide computer network for economic planning — essentially a Soviet internet. Killed by bureaucratic resistance: the Central Statistical Administration and Gosplan saw computerized planning as a threat to their institutional relevance. The people running the system blocked the tool that might have improved it. Benjamin Peters documented this in *How Not to Network a Nation* (2016).

## The Compounding — How Cracks Interact and Amplify

### The Compounding Cycle

```
Central planners lack information (Crack 3: calculation problem)
    → Suboptimal allocation decisions
        → Local actors game the system (Crack 2 + Crack 3: free-riding + distortion)
            → Planners respond with MORE control (Crack 5: rigidity)
                → Increased gaming incentive, reduced innovation incentive (Crack 2 amplified)
                    → Elite uses monitoring apparatus for self-enrichment (Crack 1: nomenklatura)
                        → Ideology rationalizes failures (Crack 4: blindness)
                            → Innovation dies (risk punished, gaming rewarded)
                                → Economic stagnation
                                    → Legitimacy crisis
                                        → Collapse or forced reform
```

### The Data Trail

**Soviet agricultural trajectory:**
- 1960s-1970s: The USSR, with some of the world's best agricultural land, became a net grain importer (~20-40 million tons annually by the late 1970s-80s)
- ~20-30% of production lost between harvest and consumer due to inadequate storage/transportation
- Infrastructure consistently under-invested because it was less politically visible than heavy industry

**Innovation metrics:**
- USSR produced ~25% of the world's scientists and engineers but generated a fraction of global patents and commercial innovations
- In computing, fell behind by ~a decade by the 1970s; decision to clone IBM mainframes cemented dependence
- Never developed competitive consumer electronics, automotive, or software industry

**The death spiral:** Each crack makes the others worse. Information problems make planning failures more severe → increases gaming → degrades information quality → elite becomes more defensive → ideological rationalization intensifies → reform becomes impossible → stagnation deepens. The system enters a spiral where every attempted fix worsens the underlying dynamics.

## Where Central Coordination Actually Works

The framework predicts success when conditions that create cracks are absent or mitigated.

### Military Logistics
- **Clear, measurable objective** — defeat the enemy; hard to game
- **External alignment** — existential threat suppresses free-riding
- **Short time horizon** — limits compounding period
- **Legitimate authority** — officers leading from the front ≠ bureaucrats in Moscow
- **Simplified information** — narrower goods set with clearer demand signals

### Emergency Response
- **Temporary** — days to weeks, not decades
- **Clear metrics** — lives saved, infrastructure restored
- **Moral clarity** — urgency suppresses self-interest
- **Focused scope** — bounded coordination problem

### Infrastructure
- **Natural monopoly** — competing water pipe networks are inefficient
- **Long time horizons** — private actors underinvest; central coordination fills the gap
- **Technical clarity** — engineering problems have defined solutions
- **Measurable outputs** — electricity delivered, water quality, road conditions

### Wartime Economies
- US War Production Board: 300,000 aircraft, 86,000 tanks, 2 million trucks in 4 years
- Soviet factory relocation: 1,500+ factories moved east of Urals in 1941-42 — perhaps the most impressive logistical feat of the 20th century
- **What made these different:** Temporary + external threat + simplified objective + markets partially preserved + democratic accountability (US/UK)

**The framework's prediction:** When wartime coordination was extended beyond the war (as in the USSR's permanent war-economy footing), it developed all five cracks.

### Modern Experiments

**Chile's Cybersyn (1971-1973).** Stafford Beer's real-time economic management system using telex networks. Showed promise managing supply chains during a truckers' strike (1972), destroyed in the 1973 coup. Too brief to determine if it would have developed the other cracks.

**Chinese Economic Planning with Big Data.** China's hybrid system uses market mechanisms for most allocation but retains central control over strategic sectors. Results: extraordinary growth (now slowing from ~10% to ~5%), but persistent SOE misallocation, massive real estate malinvestment (ghost cities, Evergrande), and increasing rigidity as Xi centralizes power. Technology helps with calculation but does not address power-seeking, free-riding, ideological blindness, or rigidity.

**Walmart as "Planned Economy."** Phillips and Rozworski (*The People's Republic of Walmart*, 2019) note Walmart's internal supply chain coordinates more products than the Soviet Union ever managed. But crucial limits: operates *within* a market economy, faces competition, employees can leave, planning is constrained to a single objective (profit), and information processed (sales data) is simpler than society-wide welfare optimization.

---

## What Survived and Evolved

### Nordic Social Democracy

Accepted Marx's *diagnosis* while rejecting his *treatment*:

**Kept:** Markets produce unacceptable inequality; workers need collective bargaining; universal public services reduce precarity; progressive taxation funds redistribution.

**Added hedges:** Markets preserved (avoiding calculation problem + motivation crisis). Strong unions balanced by employer organizations. Universal rather than means-tested benefits (reducing gaming). Democratic accountability (governments that fail are voted out). Open economies (preventing insulation from feedback).

**Durability:** Remarkably stable ~1945-present, but has evolved (Sweden reformed in 1990s, Denmark introduced "flexicurity"). The model has the *capacity to adapt* because democratic accountability and market feedback create reform pressure that centrally planned systems lack.

### Chinese Hybrid Model

**Kept:** Party control of strategic sectors (hedge against market short-termism). State-owned enterprises in "commanding heights."

**Abandoned:** Collective agriculture (addressed Crack 2). Central pricing (addressed Crack 3). Ideological purity as advancement criterion (partially addressed Crack 4 — reversing under Xi). Economic autarky (WTO in 2001 exposed firms to market feedback).

**What this tells us:** Hedges that work address genuine market failures (infrastructure, short-termism, industrial development) while preserving market signals and individual incentives. Hedges that fail suppress information, eliminate motivation, or concentrate power without accountability.

**Warning signs under Xi:** Recentralization should produce familiar compounding — reduced information quality, increased gaming, reduced innovation, stagnation. Early indicators (slowing growth, tech crackdowns, real estate crisis, youth unemployment 20%+) are consistent.

### Worker Cooperatives (Mondragon)

~80,000 worker-owners, ~€12B annual revenue.

**Why it works:** Market discipline preserved (external feedback). Democratic governance (worker-owners vote on management). Bounded scale (social pressure mitigates free-riding). Wage compression but not equality (historically 3:1, now 6:1-9:1). Strong Basque cultural identity (non-economic motivation).

**Where it struggles:** Free-riding increases at scale. Hired non-member workers in international subsidiaries (two-tier workforce contradicting principles). Fagor Electrodomesticos went bankrupt in 2013.

### Which Socialist Insights Were Correct

| Socialist Insight | Modern Implementation | Status |
|-------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Workers need protection from employer power | Labor law, minimum wage, workplace safety | Universal in developed economies |
| Healthcare shouldn't be rationed by ability to pay | Universal healthcare | Broadly accepted |
| Education is a public good | Universal public education | Universal |
| Old age shouldn't mean poverty | Social Security / state pensions | Universal |
| Unemployment is systemic risk, not individual failure | Unemployment insurance | Universal |
| Market monopolies harm consumers | Antitrust regulation | Universal (enforcement varies) |

**The pattern:** The socialist *diagnosis* of specific market failures was largely correct. The remedy — replacing the market entirely — was wrong because it created worse failures. The effective remedy: address specific failures with specific interventions while preserving the market's information and incentive functions.

## The AI Question

### Could AI Solve the Calculation Problem?

Cosma Shalizi (Carnegie Mellon, 2012 essay "In Soviet Union, Optimization Problem Solves You"):
- Linear programming for optimal allocation is computationally tractable in principle
- BUT the real economy involves externalities, public goods, increasing returns, complementarities, and agents whose behavior changes in response to the plan
- The general problem is at minimum NP-hard
- Even with free computation, the *data collection* problem remains — agents have incentives to misrepresent (Crack 3)
- **Conclusion:** Markets are not optimal, but they are a decentralized, robust computation remarkably good at approximating solutions to otherwise intractable problems

### The Remaining Human-Nature Cracks

Even if AI solved the calculation problem:

- **Power-seeking (Crack 1):** Who controls the AI? Who sets its objective function? The entity controlling the planning AI would have more power than any central planner in history
- **Free-riding (Crack 2):** AI can optimize allocation but cannot force effort. Unless it monitors and punishes shirking (surveillance dystopia)
- **Information distortion (Crack 3 variant):** Goodhart's Law applies to AI with even greater force. If AI allocates based on reported needs, agents will misrepresent. Adversarial dynamics already visible in algorithmic trading, SEO gaming, social media optimization
- **Ideological blindness (Crack 4):** AI encodes designers' values. An AI trained to maximize "socialist production" would systematically misallocate, just faster
- **Rigidity (Crack 5):** Large AI systems are hard to retrain. Constituencies benefiting from current AI decisions would resist modification

### The Framework's Prediction

**AI does not change human nature.** It changes coordination efficiency, which helps with Crack 3 but doesn't address Cracks 1, 2, 4, or 5. An AI-planned economy would be more efficient than Gosplan but would still develop the same pathologies — potentially faster because increased planning efficiency increases the payoff to capturing control.

**Most productive use of AI:** Not replacing markets but augmenting them — better information aggregation, better matching, better regulation, better public goods provision. Essentially the Nordic model with better tools.

---

## Implications for the Central Thesis

The socialism case **strongly supports** the thesis with a critical refinement:

1. **The hedges solved real problems.** Marx's diagnosis of exploitation, alienation, and coordination failure was substantively correct.

2. **The hedges created new cracks for the same tendencies.** Abolishing private property redirected power-seeking through party structures. Decoupling reward from contribution produced free-riding. Central planning made information problems worse by destroying price signals and creating distortion incentives.

3. **The cracks compound because they reinforce each other.** Bad information → bad decisions → gaming → worse information → power concentration → ideological rationalization → reform blocked → stagnation.

4. **Central coordination works when crack conditions are absent:** temporary duration, clear objectives, external alignment, bounded scope, maintained accountability.

5. **Hybrids work best** — markets for allocation (avoiding calculation and motivation problems), democratic governance for collective decisions (avoiding entrenchment), social insurance for redistribution (addressing genuine failures), cultural institutions for alignment.

6. **Technology changes tools but not tendencies.** The question is not "can AI plan an economy?" but "what governance structure ensures AI serves the many rather than being captured by the few?" — which is the original political question, not a technical one.
