# EFFORT: Brainstorming & Research

## Purpose

Deep research and brainstorming to explore all aspects of the Agent Commons concept, justify and clarify the project through research, and explore implications.

**Core Impetus:**
> Everything will change with the introduction of AI. How can we steer that change to make a better world?
>
> This is the very pith of the idea—all else might change around it. What we have described so far is just one manifestation of what the world might be in that future. There may be other ways, very different from this, so we will keep that in mind.

## Research Areas

This effort maintains these as a tracked research list:

### 1. Problems with Organizational Structures

How to avoid the failures of:

- [ ] **Democracy** — Mob-ocracy, tyranny of the majority, short-termism
  - Research examples of democratic failure modes
  - Study how AI could mitigate these issues
  - Analyze when democracy works and when it fails

- [ ] **Socialism** — Central planning failures, free-rider problem, innovation stagnation
  - Research historical socialist experiments
  - Understand the free-rider problem and potential solutions
  - Study innovation incentives in socialist systems

- [ ] **Corporatism** — Hierarchy, exploitation, rent-seeking, C-suite extraction, inertia
  - Analyze how corporate structures break down under their own weight
  - Study C-suite compensation vs. value creation
  - Research organizational inertia and resistance to change

- [ ] **Other Models** — Cooperatives, kibbutzim, holacracy, etc.
  - Worker cooperatives (Mondragon, etc.)
  - Israeli kibbutzim (successes and failures)
  - Holacracy and other flat organizational models
  - What worked? What failed? Why?

### 2. AI-Driven Societal Changes

The democratization of knowledge and skill:

- [ ] **Corporate Structure Breakdown**
  - How does AI level the playing field?
  - What happens when small teams have expert-level capability?
  - How does corporate inertia become a fatal weakness?

- [ ] **Self-Organizing Teams**
  - How can small teams fill the gap left by corporations?
  - What organizational patterns emerge naturally?
  - Building on gig economy (Upwork, Fiverr) but going further

- [ ] **Knowledge Democratization**
  - What happens when anyone can access expert-level capability through AI?
  - The end of knowledge hoarding as competitive advantage
  - How does this change power dynamics?

- [ ] **Economic Implications**
  - How do productivity gains get distributed?
  - What happens to employment and income?
  - New economic models needed?

### 3. Similar Models and Precedents

What already exists to build upon:

- [ ] **Open-Source Movement**
  - Governance models (Linux Foundation, Apache, etc.)
  - Contribution tracking and reputation systems
  - Sustainability challenges (who pays?)
  - Success patterns and failure modes

- [ ] **GitHub as Organizational Infrastructure**
  - Issues as work tracking
  - Pull requests as contribution model
  - Forks as organizational evolution
  - Stars as reputation system
  - How could this extend to non-code work?

- [ ] **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)**
  - What worked in DAO experiments?
  - What failed spectacularly?
  - Why did token-voting lead to plutocracy?
  - Can AI governance avoid these pitfalls?

- [ ] **Platform Cooperatives**
  - Examples: Stocksy, Resonate, Fairmondo
  - Governance structures
  - Member ownership vs. platform ownership
  - Successes and challenges

- [ ] **Prediction Markets & Mechanism Design**
  - How can we design systems that align incentives?
  - What can we learn from prediction markets?
  - Futarchy (voting on values, betting on beliefs)

- [ ] **Academic Research**
  - AI-governed organizations
  - Multi-agent systems
  - Game theory and mechanism design
  - Organizational economics

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive understanding of organizational failure modes
- [ ] Clear articulation of how AI changes the landscape
- [ ] Documented precedents with analysis of successes/failures
- [ ] Multiple potential organizational models beyond Agent Commons
- [ ] Identified key risks and how to hedge against them
- [ ] Research findings documented for future reference

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-12: Effort Created
- Initialized effort with comprehensive research areas
- Structured research as trackable checklist
- Linked to goal G12.1

## Notes

The Agent Commons three-layer model (Agent → Forg → Commons) is one possible answer. Through this research, we may discover very different models that better serve the core question: **How can we steer AI-driven change toward a better world?**

Stay intellectually honest. Stay open to pivots. The goal is not to prove the Agent Commons concept—it's to find the best path forward.
